# Genuary 2025

My participation in [Genuary 2025](https://genuary.art), a month of daily generative art prompts.

## 🎨 About

Genuary is an artificially generated month of time where we build code that makes beautiful things. Each day has a different prompt that participants interpret to create generative art.

This project uses:
- TypeScript for type-safe JavaScript
- Vite for fast development and optimized builds
- Kansei for creative coding

## 🚀 Getting Started
